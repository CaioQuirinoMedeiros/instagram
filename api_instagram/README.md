# API

It's a simple instagram's like application. The user can upload a photo with a description, location and hashtags, others users can see that post and like it as much as they want.

It uses socket.io to make it a real-time application

## Setting up

The only needed setup is a MongoDB url connection in a .env file, then you can run `yarn dev` to run in development mode
